				<h3>Intrest in IT</h3>
			</header>
					<p>I am very interested in the state of technology and that we can’t survive without it, growing up with it and watching it evolve to this state. My earliast memory of IT was first year of highschool at age 12 my parents got home wifi and internet conection later than my friends but it open a whole new world and never ending posibilities. I’m not really that experienced with specifics and in depths part of IT but using technology everyday has encouraged me to seek as much information as I can about the devices I use.</p>
					<p>The main reason I choose RMIT is because its close to wear I live but, It specialises in career paths that I'm intrested in.</p>
					<p>I would like to learn the fundamentals of IT specifically Programming and the different languages. I want to feel like I've learnt the depth of the world of technology.</p>

			<p>Server Management/System Administrator.</p>
			<p>These Job imply that you basically Monitoring the server and apps running on the server. Checking the status uptime and monitoring for any new or recurring issues. Updating the server and software installed in the server Setup and configuration all while having a clear understanding of different programming languages and 3-5 years of experience in the industry. These Jobs apeal to me because they tend to pay well and are more tended towards my personality of not having to much public interactions and not to much traveling. The qualifications and expirience required are pretty high for my level at the momment considering im a beginner, but with the knowledge that I recieve from this course and the understanding of IT that I have now I have faith that I can gain skills required for these high paying jobs. Because I'm a Amatuer I plan go through the process of trial&error and gain expirience through self studing whether thats reaserching online or watching tutorials or asking questions where I don't understand and because I believe that I am a fast learner, once I gain a fundemental understanding of these topics and have been taught well I will gain expirience overtime.</p>
