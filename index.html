				<h3>Intrest in IT</h3>
			</header>
					<p>I am very interested in the state of technology and that we can’t survive without it, growing up with it and watching it evolve to this state. My earliast memory of IT was first year of highschool at age 12 my parents decided to get home wifi and internet conection later than my friends but it open a whole new world and never ending posibilities. I’m not that experienced with specifics and in depths part of IT but using technology everyday has encouraged me to seek as much information as I can about the devices I use.</p>
					<p>The main reason I choose RMIT is because its close to where I live but, It specialises in career paths that I'm intrested in.</p>
					<p>I would like to learn the fundamentals of IT specifically Programming and the different languages. I want to feel like I've learnt the depth of the world of technology while being able to understand use the right terminology in IT.</p>

			<p>Server Management/System Administrator.</p>
			<p>These Job imply that you basically Monitoring the server and apps running on the server. Checking the status uptime and monitoring for any new or recurring issues. Updating the server and software installed in the server Setup and configuration all while having a clear understanding of different programming languages and 3-5 years of experience in the industry. These Jobs apeal to me because they tend to pay well and are more catered towards my personality of not having to much public interactions and not to much traveling. The qualifications and expirience required are pretty high for my level at the momment considering im a beginner, but with the knowledge that I recieve from this course and the understanding of IT that I have now I have faith that I can gain skills required for these high paying jobs. Because I'm a Amatuer I plan go through a tough process of learning the hardway mainly relying on trial&error and gain expirience through self studing whether thats reaserching online or watching tutorials or asking questions where I don't understand and because I believe that I am a fast learner, once I gain a fundemental understanding of these topics and have been taught well I will gain expirience overtime.</p>

				<p>Myers-Briggs test:  The results state that my personality type is
					<a 
href="https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality">VIRTUOSO (ISTP-A)</a></p>
                <p>This result means I'm hands on with my work learning through trials&error I tend to be quite/reserved and open for ideas but will take lead if necesarry. This test won't change the way I behave in a team and I will not really take it into account when forming a group.</p>
				
				<p>lerning style test:  The results say i'm a 
					<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=2&V=6&T=12">TACTICLE learner</a></p>
				<p>This result that I'm majority Tacticle in the way I approach situations and hands on with my learning process. It also states that I tend to get bored and start tinkering/fidgeting objects. This test won't change the way I behave in a team and I will not really take it into account when forming a group.</p>
				
				<p>Big Five Personality test:
				 <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.1,4.5,3.2,3.4,3.1"> Test Results</a></p>
				<p>These results state I'm more introverted and tend to be reserved by choice.
					Every other characteristic is pretty nuetrul aside from my emotional stability which states its very high and I don't get upset/angry easily. This test won't change the way I behave in a team and I will not really take it into account when forming a group.</p>

						<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
					</header>
					
					<p>For a Project Ideas I want to create something that I wouold use daily. It would be a very practical tool and judging from my this assignment and my personality results (which is somewhat accurate) you can probably tell that my personality cater towards efficency practicality & simplicity in a project. So having a flashy project that I won't use wouldn't be ideal, but I won't argue if somebody in the group has a more productive Idea.</p>
					<p>My 1st project idea is basically a dashboard with simple function like time, calander, weather, calculator notes, reminders etc. It would probably be the most practical for every day use either app form, website form or just as an extension. We would praobably focaus more on disign aspect with coding skills required.</p>
					<p>2nd project idea would be creating a vioce activated assistant kind of like siri or alexa. probably the toughest in theory seeing we would have to focus on the both hardware and software unless we decide to make an app or website but a mechanical robotic assistant would be cool too and would amazing if done correct. Programming skills required</p>
					<p>3rd idea would be developing some sort of game, would be the funnest project to work on and would require alot of programming knowledge (java if im not mistaken) would love our group to play it together once it was done and enjoy the time while we make it. Possibly the most programming required out of the others ideas</p>
