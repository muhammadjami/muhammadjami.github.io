				<h3>Intrest in IT</h3>
			</header>
					<p>I am very interested in the state of technology and that we can’t survive without it, growing up with it and watching it evolve to this state. My earliast memory of IT was first year of highschool at age 12 my parents got home wifi and internet conection later than my friends but it open a whole new world and never ending posibilities. I’m not really that experienced with specifics and in depths part of IT but using technology everyday has encouraged me to seek as much information as I can about the devices I use.</p>
					<p>The main reason I choose RMIT is because its close to wear I live but, It specialises in career paths that I'm intrested in.</p>
					<p>I would like to learn the fundamentals of IT specifically Programming and the different languages. I want to feel like I've learnt the depth of the world of technology.</p>
